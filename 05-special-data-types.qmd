## Objectives {#ch5-objectives .unnumbered}

This chapter is heavily outsourced to [r4ds](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) as they do a much better job at providing examples and covering the extensive functionality of each of the packages than I myself would ever be able to.

+ Use `forcats` to reorder and relabel factor variables in data cleaning steps and data visualizations.
+ Clean and extract information from character strings using `stringr`
+ Work with date and time variables using `lubridate`

## Factors with `forcats`

We have been floating around the idea of *factor* data types. In this chapter, we will formally define factors and why they are needed for data visualization and analysis. We will then learn useful functions for working with factors in our data cleaning steps.

In short, factors are categorical variables with a fixed number of values (think a set number of groups). One of the main features that set factors apart from groups is that you can reorder the groups to be non-alphabetical. In this section we will be using the `forcats` package (part of the `tidyverse`!) to create and manipulate factor variables.

## Check-in 5.1: Functions from `forcats` {#checkin5-1 .unnumbered}

Answer the following questions in the Canvas Quiz.

**1. Which of the following tasks can `fct_recode()` accomplish?**

+ changes the values of the factor levels
+ reorders the levels of a factor
+ remove levels of a factor you don’t want
+ collapse levels of a factor into a new level

**2. Which of the following tasks can `fct_relevel()` accomplish?**

+ reorders the levels of a factor
+ changes the values of the factor levels
+ remove levels of a factor you don’t want
+ collapse levels of a factor into a new level

**3. What is the main difference between `fct_collapse()` and `fct_recode()`?**

+ `fct_recode()` uses strings to create factor levels
+ `fct_recode()` uses groups to create factor levels

<!-- ### What is a factor? -->

<!-- Let's take a look at a vector, `days` which contains days of the week. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- days <- c("Wed", "Thurs", "Sun", "Sun", "Mon") -->
<!-- days -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The values in our vectors are categorical variables and therefore, `R` is automatically going to read the vector in as a character data type.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- class(days) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- But let's think about what is contained in this vector. There are only seven days of the week and there is a natural ordering to those values.  -->

<!-- ::: warning -->

<!-- Working with `days` as a character vector introduces a couple of problems: -->

<!-- 1. There is nothing saving you from typos -- e.g., *Web* -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- days_misspelled <- c("Web", "Thurs", "Sun", "Sun", "Mon") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- 2. and it sorts alphabetically. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- sort(days) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- We can convert `days` to a vector of `factor()` data types by defining a valid ordering and passing it into the levels function argument. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- day_levels <- c("Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun") -->
<!-- days_fct <- factor(days, levels = day_levels) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We can then see the `levels()` of our factor variable. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- levels(days_fct) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Any values not defined as a factor level will be converted to <NA> just like `as.numeric()` did to values which were not numbers. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| error: true -->
<!-- factor(days_misspelled, levels = day_levels) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Alternatively, you might accidentally miss the misspelling so using `fct()` from the `forcats` package will provide an error to alert you of the misspelling. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| error: true -->
<!-- fct(days_misspelled, levels = day_levels) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You do not have to specify the levels when converting a variable into a vector, but they will automatically be defined in alphabetical order and the levels will only contain those values which appear in the original vector. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- factor(days) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Factor Order -->

<!-- It may be useful, particularly in data visualizations, to order a factor variable based on the value of another variable. -->

<!-- ::: ex -->

<!-- Let's work with the `cereal` data set in the `liver` package. This data set contains nutrituional, manufacture, and marketing information for various cereals. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(liver) -->
<!-- data(cereal) -->
<!-- str(cereal, hide.attr = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Notice that manufacture `manuf` is a factor variable. Let's investigate! -->

<!-- The levels of the manufacture factor variable follows alphabetical order.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- levels(cereal$manuf) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We can use `count()` to find how many cereals are produced by each manufacturer. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- cereal |>  -->
<!--   count(manuf) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We can use `dplyr` verbs to obtain summary statistics on nutritional content of the cereals for each manufacturer. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- cereal_summary <- cereal |> -->
<!--   group_by(manuf) |>  -->
<!--   summarise(avg_sugars = mean(sugars), -->
<!--             n = n() -->
<!--             ) -->
<!-- cereal_summary -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ::: panel-tabset -->

<!-- ### Original Plot -->

<!-- We can create a plot displaying the average sugar for each manufacture. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- cereal_summary |>  -->
<!-- ggplot(aes(x = avg_sugars, y = manuf)) + -->
<!--   geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = manuf)) + -->
<!--   geom_point() + -->
<!--   labs(x = "Average Sugar (grams)", -->
<!--        subtitle = "Manufacture Company", -->
<!--        y = "") + -->
<!--   theme_bw() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This is nice, but the points/segments are a little "out of order" or sporadic. Wouldn't it be nice if we could `reorder()` the levels of manufacture so that our plot shows the manufactures with the highest average sugar at the top?  -->

<!-- ### `fct_reorder()` -->

<!-- To accomplish this, we can use `fct_reorder()`: -->

<!-- + `f`, the factor variable whose levels you want to modify -->
<!-- + `x`, the numeric variable you want to use to reorder the levels -->
<!-- + (optional) `fun`, a function that is used if there are multiple values of the numeric variable for each factor group. The default function is the median. -->

<!-- Use `fct_reorder(manuf, avg_sugars)`! This looks a lot nicer. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- cereal_summary |>  -->
<!-- ggplot(aes(x = avg_sugars, y = fct_reorder(manuf, avg_sugars))) + -->
<!--   geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = manuf)) + -->
<!--   geom_point() + -->
<!--   labs(x = "Average Sugar (grams)", -->
<!--        subtitle = "Manufacture Company", -->
<!--        y = "") + -->
<!--   theme_bw() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Notice how we reordered within our `ggplot` code? You may want to do this before passing the data set in with the `mutate()` `dplyr` verb. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- #| eval: false -->
<!-- cereal_summary |>  -->
<!--   mutate(manuf = fct_reorder(manuf, avg_sugars)) |>  -->
<!-- ggplot(aes(x = avg_sugars, y = manuf)) + -->
<!--   geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = manuf)) + -->
<!--   geom_point() + -->
<!--   labs(x = "Average Sugar (grams)", -->
<!--        subtitle = "Manufacture Company", -->

## String Operations with `stringr`

Nearly always, when multiple variables are stored in a single column, they are stored as character variables. There are many different "levels" of working with strings in programming, from simple find-and-replaced of fixed (constant) strings to regular expressions, which are extremely powerful (and extremely complicated).

<!-- ##### Converting Columns Directly {.unnumbered} -->

<!-- Obviously, we can also convert some strings to numbers using type conversion functions that we discussed in @sec-type-conversions. This is fairly easy in R, but a bit more complex in Python, because Python has several different types of 'missing' or NA variables that are not necessarily compatible. -->

<!-- Here, we use the `across` helper function from dplyr to convert all of the columns to numeric. Note that the last 3 columns don't work here, because they contain characters R doesn't recognize as numeric characters. -->

<!-- ```{r direct-type-conversion-r} -->
<!-- library(dplyr) -->

<!-- df_numeric <- mutate(df, across(everything(), as.numeric)) -->
<!-- str(df_numeric) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ::: callout-caution -->
<!-- ##### Example: Converting Y/N data -->

<!-- The next thing we might want to do is convert our `custom` column so that it has 1 instead of Y and 0 instead of N. There are several ways we can handle this process: -->

<!-- -   We could use factors/categorical variables, which have numeric values "under the hood", but show up as labeled. -->
<!-- -   We could (in this particular case) test for equality with "Y", but this approach would not generalize well if we had more than 2 categories. -->
<!-- -   We could take a less nuanced approach and just find-replace and then convert to a number. -->

<!-- Some of these solutions are more kludgy than others, but I've used all 3 approaches when dealing with categorical data in the past, depending on what I wanted to do with it afterwards. -->

<!-- ```{r conversion-find-replace-r} -->
<!-- library(stringr) # work with strings easily -->
<!-- fixed_df = fixed_df %>% -->
<!--   mutate( -->
<!--     # factor approach -->
<!--     custom1 = factor(custom, levels = c("N", "Y"), labels = c("Y", "N")), -->
<!--     # test for equality -->
<!--     custom2 = (custom == "Y"), -->
<!--     # string replacement -->
<!--     custom3 = str_replace_all(custom, c("Y" = "1", "N" = "0")) %>% -->
<!--       as.numeric() -->
<!--   ) -->

<!-- str(fixed_df) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ### Using find and replace -->

<!-- Another way to fix some issues is to just find-and-replace the problematic characters. This is not always the best solution[^data-transformations-2], and may introduce bugs if you use the same code to analyze new data with characters you haven't anticipated, but in so many cases it's also the absolute easiest, fastest, simplest way forward and easily solves many different problems. -->

<!-- [^data-transformations-2]: It's particularly hackish when you're working with locale-specific settings [@herrmannHowDealInternational2021], and in many cases you can handle locale issues much more elegantly. -->

<!-- [I'll show you how to correct all of the issues reading in the data using solutions shown above, but please do consider reading @herrmannHowDealInternational2021 so that you know why find-and-replace isn't (necessarily) the best option for locale-specific formatting.]{.aside} -->

<!-- ::: callout-caution -->
<!-- ##### Example: find and replace -->

<!-- Let's start with the money column. -->

<!-- In R, parse_number() handles the money column just fine - the pound sign goes away and we get a numeric value. This didn't work by default with type_convert, but as long as we `mutate` and tell R we expect a number, things work well. Then, as we did above, we can specify the locale settings so that decimal and grouping marks are handled correctly even for countries which use ',' for decimal and '.' for thousands separators. -->

<!-- ```{r guess-type-conversion-r-money} -->
<!-- fixed_df = df %>% -->
<!--   type_convert() %>% # guess everything -->
<!--   mutate(money_col = parse_number(money_col), -->
<!--          eu_numbers = parse_number(eu_numbers,  -->
<!--                                    locale = locale(decimal_mark = ',',  -->
<!--                                                    grouping_mark = '.'))) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ::: callout-caution -->
<!-- #### Example: Locale find-and-replace -->

<!-- We could also handle the locale issues using find-and-replace, if we wanted to... -->

<!-- Note that `str_remove` is shorthand for `str_replace(x, pattern, "")`. There is a little bit of additional complexity in switching "," for "." and vice versa - we have to change "," to something else first, so that we can replace "." with ",". This is *not* elegant but it does work. It also doesn't generalize - it will mess up numbers formatted using the US/UK convention, and it won't handle numbers formatted using other conventions from other locales. -->

<!-- ```{r find-replace-locale-r} -->
<!-- fixed_df = df %>% -->
<!--   type_convert() %>% # guess everything -->
<!--   mutate(money_col = str_remove(money_col, "£") %>% parse_number(), -->
<!--          eu_numbers = str_replace_all(eu_numbers,  -->
<!--                                       c("," = "_",  -->
<!--                                         "\\." = ",",  -->
<!--                                         "_" = ".")) %>% -->
<!--            parse_number()) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ::: -->

### Regular Expressions

Matching exact strings is easy - it's just like using find and replace.

```{r regular-expressions}
human_talk <- "blah, blah, blah. Do you want to go for a walk?"
dog_hears <- str_extract(human_talk, "walk")
dog_hears
```

But, if you can master even a small amount of regular expression notation, you'll have exponentially more power to do good (or evil) when working with strings. You can get by without regular expressions if you're creative, but often they're much simpler.

<details class="ex">

<summary>Short Regular Expressions Primer</summary>

You may find it helpful to follow along with this section using this [web app](https://spannbaueradam.shinyapps.io/r_regex_tester/) built to test R regular expressions. The subset of regular expression syntax we're going to cover here is fairly limited, but [you can find regular expressions to do just about anything string-related](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/regex?tab=Votes). As with any tool, there are situations where it's useful, and situations where you should not use a regular expression, no matter how much you want to.

Here are the basics of regular expressions:

-   `[]` enclose sets of characters\
    Ex: `[abc]` will match any single character `a`, `b`, `c`
    -   `-` specifies a range of characters (`A-z` matches all upper and lower case letters)
    -   to match `-` exactly, precede with a backslash (outside of `[]`) or put the `-` last (inside `[]`)
-   `.` matches any character (except a newline)
-   To match special characters, escape them using `\` (in most languages) or `\\` (in R). So `\.` or `\\.` will match a literal `.`, `\$` or `\\$` will match a literal `$`.

```{r phone-strings}
num_string <- "phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789"

ssn <- str_extract(num_string, "[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]")
ssn
```

Listing out all of those numbers can get repetitive, though. How do we specify repetition?

-   `*` means repeat between 0 and inf times
-   `+` means 1 or more times
-   `?` means 0 or 1 times -- most useful when you're looking for something optional
-   `{a, b}` means repeat between `a` and `b` times, where `a` and `b` are integers. `b` can be blank. So `[abc]{3,}` will match `abc`, `aaaa`, `cbbaa`, but not `ab`, `bb`, or `a`. For a single number of repeated characters, you can use `{a}`. So `{3, }` means "3 or more times" and `{3}` means "exactly 3 times"

```{r regular-expression-banana}
library(stringr)
str_extract("banana", "[a-z]{1,}") # match any sequence of lowercase characters
str_extract("banana", "[ab]{1,}") # Match any sequence of a and b characters
str_extract_all("banana", "(..)") # Match any two characters
str_extract("banana", "(..)\\1") # Match a repeated thing
```

```{r regular-expression-phone-ssn}
num_string <- "phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789, bank account balance: $50,000,000.23"

ssn <- str_extract(num_string, "[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}")
ssn
phone <- str_extract(num_string, "[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{4}")
phone
nuid <- str_extract(num_string, "[0-9]{8}")
nuid
bank_balance <- str_extract(num_string, "\\$[0-9,]+\\.[0-9]{2}")
bank_balance
```

There are also ways to "anchor" a pattern to a part of the string (e.g. the beginning or the end)

-   `^` has multiple meanings:
    -   if it's the first character in a pattern, `^` matches the beginning of a string
    -   if it follows `[`, e.g. `[^abc]`, `^` means "not" - for instance, "the collection of all characters that aren't a, b, or c".
-   `$` means the end of a string

Combined with pre and post-processing, these let you make sense out of semi-structured string data, such as addresses.

```{r regular-expression-addresses}
address <- "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500"

house_num <- str_extract(address, "^[0-9]{1,}")

 # Match everything alphanumeric up to the comma
street <- str_extract(address, "[A-z0-9 ]{1,}")
street <- str_remove(street, house_num) %>% str_trim() # remove house number

city <- str_extract(address, ",.*,") %>% str_remove_all(",") %>% str_trim()

zip <- str_extract(address, "[0-9-]{5,10}$") # match 5 and 9 digit zip codes
```

-   `()` are used to capture information. So `([0-9]{4})` captures any 4-digit number
-   `a|b` will select a or b.

If you've captured information using (), you can reference that information using backreferences. In most languages, those look like this: `\1` for the first reference, `\9` for the ninth. In R, backreferences are `\\1` through `\\9`.

In R, the `\` character is special, so you have to escape it. So in R, `\\1` is the first reference, and `\\2` is the second, and so on.

```{r regular-expression-fancier-r}
phone_num_variants <- c("(123) 456-7980", "123.456.7890", "+1 123-456-7890")
phone_regex <- "\\+?[0-9]{0,3}? ?\\(?([0-9]{3})?\\)?.?([0-9]{3}).?([0-9]{4})"
# \\+?[0-9]{0,3} matches the country code, if specified, 
#    but won't take the first 3 digits from the area code 
#    unless a country code is also specified
# \\( and \\) match literal parentheses if they exist
# ([0-9]{3})? captures the area code, if it exists
# .? matches any character
# ([0-9]{3}) captures the exchange code
# ([0-9]{4}) captures the 4-digit individual code

str_extract(phone_num_variants, phone_regex)
str_replace(phone_num_variants, phone_regex, "\\1\\2\\3")
# We didn't capture the country code, so it remained in the string

human_talk <- "blah, blah, blah. Do you want to go for a walk? I think I'm going to treat myself to some ice cream for working so hard. "
dog_hears <- str_extract_all(human_talk, "walk|treat")
dog_hears
```

Putting it all together, we can test our regular expressions to ensure that they are specific enough to pull out what we want, while not pulling out other similar information:

```{r regex-r-version-of-sas}
strings <- c("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABAB",
"banana orange strawberry apple",
"ana went to montana to eat a banana",
"call me at 432-394-2873. Do you want to go for a walk? I'm going to treat myself to some ice cream for working so hard.",
"phone: (123) 456-7890, nuid: 12345678, bank account balance: $50,000,000.23",
"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500")

phone_regex <- "\\+?[0-9]{0,3}? ?\\(?([0-9]{3})?\\)?.?([0-9]{3}).([0-9]{4})"
dog_regex <- "(walk|treat)"
addr_regex <- "([0-9]*) ([A-z0-9 ]{3,}), ([A-z\\. ]{3,}), ([0-9]{5})"
abab_regex <- "(..)\\1"

tibble(
  text = strings,
  phone = str_detect(strings, phone_regex),
  dog = str_detect(strings, dog_regex),
  addr = str_detect(strings, addr_regex),
  abab = str_detect(strings, abab_regex))
```

## Dates & Times with `lubridate`

In order to fill in an important part of our toolbox, we need to learn how to work with date variables. These variables feel like they should be simple and intuitive given we all work with schedules and calendars everyday. However, there are little nuances that we will learn to make working with dates and times easier.
